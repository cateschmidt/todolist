# Overview

This is a to do list that allows the user to add tasks, delete tasks, edit tasks, and also saves the tasks in local storage so when the browser is refreshed, the user still has access to their to do list tasks.

This software uses CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create a to do list app. The formulas and functionality is written using javascript while the front end uses CSS and HTML.

My purpose for writing this software is to create a user friendly to do list that people can use to organize their lives.
